# Nalanda Journal ðŸ“°

Hey there! ðŸ‘‹

Welcome to **Nalanda Journal** â€“ your one-stop spot for catching up on the worldâ€™s news, without the clutter or the clickbait. This isnâ€™t your typical corporate news portal. Itâ€™s a hobby project, built for people who just want the headlines, the stories, and a chill experience.

## What is this?
A modern, clean, and responsive web app that pulls together news from all over, sorts it by category (think: Tech, Sports, Health, etc.), and lets you:
- Browse top stories from around the globe
- Bookmark and favorite articles you want to come back to
- See trending news at a glance
- Enjoy a dark mode for those late-night scrolls

## Why did I build it?
Because most news sites are either too busy, too ad-heavy, or just not fun to use. I wanted something simple, fast, and friendly â€“ for myself and anyone else whoâ€™s tired of the usual news experience.

## How do I run it?
1. **Clone this repo**
2. Run `npm install` to grab dependencies
3. Start the app with `npm run dev`
4. Open your browser and go to [http://localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173) (or whatever Vite tells you)

## Tech Stack
- [React](https://react.dev/) (for the UI)
- [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) (for speedy dev)
- [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) (for styling)
- [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/) (for auth, comments, and favorites)
- [NewsAPI](https://newsapi.org/) (for fetching news)

## Features
- Category navigation (World, Tech, Sports, etc.)
- Search for articles
- User authentication (Google, email/password)
- Save favorites and bookmarks
- Trending section
- Mobile-friendly & dark mode

## Notes & Caveats
- Youâ€™ll need your own NewsAPI and Firebase credentials to make everything work.
- This project is for learning and fun. Not for production or profit.
- PRs and suggestions are welcome if you want to play around!
